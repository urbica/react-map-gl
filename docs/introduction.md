React Component Library for [Mapbox GL JS](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-js). Mapbox GL JS is a JavaScript library that renders interactive maps from vector tiles and Mapbox styles using WebGL. This project is intended to be as close as possible to the [Mapbox GL JS API](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/).

To use any of Mapbox’s tools, APIs, or SDKs, you’ll need a Mapbox [access token](https://www.mapbox.com/help/define-access-token/). Mapbox uses access tokens to associate requests to API resources with your account. You can find all your access tokens, create new ones, or delete existing ones on your [API access tokens page](https://www.mapbox.com/studio/account/tokens/).

This package is heavily inspired by [uber/react-map-gl](https://github.com/uber/react-map-gl).
